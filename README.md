## Overview
This project explores how non-verbal cues, captured through body motion, can bridge the gap between virtual and physical communication.  

Building on the ubiquity of computational systems (ubiquitous computing), it integrates human motion as invisible data, revealing emotional nuances to enhance hybrid living. Inspired by Pierre Lévy’s assertion that virtualization “creates new realities by introducing irreversibility, indeterminacy, and creativity” (Becoming Virtual, p. 29), this project reimagines motion as a universal language that connects human agents across physical and virtual domains.  

This work builds on foundational ideas introduced in previous assignment in the course, Assignment A6: Hybrid Bodies, which explored the integration of virtual information into daily life. By critically examining hybrid living as a future norm1 , the project focuses on reimagining how users engage with and approach emotional communication in hybrid environments—emphasizing medium, timing, and context.
